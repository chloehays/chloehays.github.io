In the midst of constructing The Doddâ€“Frank Act, the most sweeping package of financial reforms since the New Deal, then-Speaker of the House John Boehner made a daunting prediction. "I think the financial reform bill is ill conceived, going to make credit harder for the American people to get, clearly harder for businesses to get and the fact that it's going to punish every banker in America for the sins of the few on Wall Street is unwise," the Speaker said. But six years later, consumers don't seem to be scrounging for credit in the wake of Dodd-Frank. Current data from the Federal Reserve show that credit availability is not only growing, but growing at a rate near (and sometimes higher than) pre-crisis levels.

In the roughly two-year period between the beginnings of the 2008 financial crisis and the signing of Dodd-Frank, the consumer credit market dried up as banks, credit unions, and other lending institutions recoiled from the crisis. But in the economic recovery, credit availability overall appears to be growing at a higher rate than pre-crisis levels.

However, only some kinds of institutions have experienced such a regrowth. Credit unions, for example, have only seen a slight increase in total credit given in the six years since the signing of the law. The paltry showing of credit unions (compared to depository institutions of all sizes) fuels the criticism that Dodd-Frank disproportionately harms community banks and credit unions, which were not considered responsible for the housing crisis and the ensuing financial meltdown.

This anti-Dodd-Frank rhetoric has remained a mainstay in the Republican agenda since the law's passage, and even into the 2016 presidential race. For example, Marco Rubio <a href="http://time.com/3988276/republican-debate-primetime-transcript-full-text/">claimed</a> during the first Republican debate in August 2015 that Dodd-Frank is "eviscerating small businesses and small banks." His comments echo those of other party elites like Newt Gingrich, who in 2011 <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/21/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-dodd-frank-destroying-community/">said</a> community banks "are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank."

Yet claims of Dodd-Frank eliminating small community banks and credit unions may be a bit dramatic. While loans from credit unions might not be growing at a similarly high rate as typical large depository institutions, they're not seeing the dips that non-depository finance companies are seeing, for example. [Something to highlight these dips here, stress point.]

But not everyone agrees with this assessment. American Action Forum, the policy research arm of the center-right advocacy organization the American Action Network, published a <a href="http://www.americanactionforum.org/research/dodd-franks-impact-on-revolving-consumer-credit/">report</a> earlier this year that found that banks (especially small banks) have been lending less in revolving credit -- the kind that replenishes over time, such as credit cards -- in the years since the financial crisis.

According to Sam Batkins, the Director of Regulatory Policy at the American Action Forum, the details of Dodd-Frank are what really count for small banks. Batkins says AAF researchers "looked to isolate the effect of the law on credit availability" using a number of controlling factors, including the housing price index, the Taylor Rule [which is used to calculate the target federal funds rate used by the Federal Reserve], and the international economy." As a result, they found a fourteen percent decline in credit availability after the law was passed when other factors were accounted for.

According to Batkins, "Dodd-Frank was always about Wall Street and reigning in big banks, but the largest percentage of compliance costs was borne mostly on small banks." He explained that financial institutions hired an average of two compliance officers after the law was passed, adding, "hiring two people at JPMorgan or Citibank is a rounding error, but for small banks that could mean going from in the black to in the red." As such, he argued that the negative effect of Dodd-Frank on the consumer credit market was a byproduct of regulatory costs passed on to consumers.

So was Boehner right? The consumer credit market overall appears to have bounced back after the shock of the financial crisis, even if Dodd-Frank has slowed the flow of credit to an extent. But with only about half of the provisions of Dodd-Frank implemented so far, it remains to be seen whether the full force of the law leads to the doomsday scenario Boehner and others predicted.

Data included in the visualization includes total consumer credit loans owned by depository institutions, finance companies, federal government entities, credit unions, educational/nonprofit institutions, and other nonfinancial businesses, all not seasonally adjusted. Data included in the interactive visualization includes revolving as well as non-revolving credit, whereas AAF's report only analyzed the revolving credit market.
